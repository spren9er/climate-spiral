# Global Climate Spiral

## Introduction

The _Climate Spiral_ is a data visualization originally designed
by climate scientist [Ed Hawkins](https://twitter.com/ed_hawkins)
from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of Reading.

This visualization is a remake of a spiral available at [https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4975](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4975)
and which was created by [Mark SubbaRao](https://twitter.com/marksubbarao) and NASA SVS
in 2022. Description from original website:

The visualization presents monthly global temperature anomalies
between the years 1880-2021. These temperatures are based on the GISS
Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4), an estimate of global
surface temperature change. Anomalies are defined relative to a base
period of 1951-1980. The data file used to create this visualization
can be accessed [here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/GLB.Ts+dSST.csv).
